        Elon Reeve Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa's administrative capital.[11][12] He is of British and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry.[13][14] His mother, Maye Musk (née Haldeman), is a model and dietitian born in Saskatchewan, Canada, and raised in South Africa.[15][16][17] His father, Errol Musk, is a South African electromechanical engineer, pilot, sailor, consultant, and property developer, who partly owned a Zambian emerald mine near Lake Tanganyika, as well as a rental lodge at the Timbavati Private Nature Reserve.[18][19][20][21] Musk has a younger brother, Kimbal, and a younger sister, Tosca.[17][22]

Musk's family was wealthy during his youth.[21] His father was elected to the Pretoria City Council as a representative of the anti-apartheid Progressive Party and has said that his children shared their father's dislike of apartheid.[11] His maternal grandfather, Joshua N. Haldeman, was an American-born Canadian who took his family on record-breaking journeys to Africa and Australia in a single-engine Bellanca airplane.[23][24][25][26] After his parents divorced in 1980, Musk chose to live primarily with his father.[13][18] Musk later regretted his decision and became estranged from his father.[27] He has a paternal half-sister and a half-brother.[23][28]

        Musk attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School, Bryanston High School, and then Pretoria Boys High School, where he graduated.[36] Musk was a good but not exceptional student, earning a 61 in Afrikaans and a B on his senior math certification.[37] Musk applied for a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother,[38][39] knowing that it would be easier to immigrate to the United States this way.[40] While waiting for his application to be processed, he attended the University of Pretoria for five months.[41]

        Musk arrived in Canada in June 1989 and lived with a second cousin in Saskatchewan for a year,[42] working odd jobs at a farm and lumber mill.[43] In 1990, he entered Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario.[44][45]
        
        Two years later, he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, an Ivy League university in Philadelphia, where he earned two degrees, a Bachelor of Arts in physics, and a Bachelor of Science degree in economics from the university's Wharton School.[46][47][48][49] Although Musk said he earned the degrees in 1995, the University of Pennsylvania maintains that they were awarded in 1997.[50] He reportedly hosted large, ticketed house parties to help pay for tuition, and wrote a business plan for an electronic book-scanning service similar to Google Books.[51]
        
        In 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley: one at energy storage startup Pinnacle Research Institute, which investigated electrolytic ultracapacitors for energy storage, and another at Palo Alto–based startup Rocket Science Games.[52][53] In 1995, he was accepted to a PhD program in materials science at Stanford University.[54][55] However, Musk decided to join the Internet boom, dropping out two days after being accepted and applied for a job at Netscape, to which he reportedly never received a response.[56][38]

    Musk is president of the Musk Foundation he founded in 2001,[254][255] whose stated purpose is to: provide solar-power energy systems in disaster areas; support research, development, and advocacy (for interests including human space exploration, pediatrics, renewable energy and "safe artificial intelligence"); and support science and engineering educational efforts.[256]

As of 2020, the foundation has made 350 donations. Around half of them were made to scientific research or education nonprofits. Notable beneficiaries include the Wikimedia Foundation, his alma mater the University of Pennsylvania, and his brother Kimbal's nonprofit Big Green.[257] From 2002 to 2018, the foundation gave $25 million directly to nonprofit organizations, nearly half of which went to Musk's OpenAI,[258] which was a nonprofit at the time.[259]

In 2012, Musk took the Giving Pledge, thereby committing to give the majority of his wealth to charitable causes either during his lifetime or in his will.[260] He has endowed prizes at the X Prize Foundation, including $100 million to reward improved carbon capture technology.[261]
